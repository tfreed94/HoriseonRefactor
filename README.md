For this project, I reworked some of code in the HTML doc and CSS stylesheet. This allowed us to use less code to achieve the same results. In the html, I removed any div tags and replaced them with semantic element tags. I also added alternate text to all of the images in the file and fixed any broken links. Lastly, I changed any classes in the html accordingly with the updated CSS class names. 

In the CSS stylesheet, I condensed and consolidated any classes with the same attributes into one class and changed some classes to element selectors. Then, I commented each new class or element selector describing what it's doing for our code.
